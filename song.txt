I ain't gonna be just a face in the crowd
You're gonna hear my voice
When I shout it out loud

This is a song for the broken-hearted
A silent prayer for the faith-departed
I ain't gonna be just a face in the crowd
You're gonna hear my voice
When I shout it out loud

It's my life
Well, it's now or never
I ain't gonna live forever
I just want to live while I'm alive
(It's my life)

My heart is like an open highway
Like Frankie said
I did it my way
I just wanna live while I'm alive
It's my life

This is for the ones who stood their ground
For Tommy and Gina who never backed down
Tomorrow's getting harder make no mistake
Luck ain't even lucky
Got to make your own breaks
